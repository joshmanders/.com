# Thoughts, Stories & Ideas from Josh Manders

This is the beginning of my Tailwind CSS based Ghost blog theme.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

### Development Mode

To run the theme in development mode, you need to run install Ghost locally with `npm run ghost:install`.

... More coming soon. I'm tired.
