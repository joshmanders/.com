Today marks the end of an era, I no longer identify as a full snack developer.

Over the last 5 years after transitioning from being a primarily PHP backend developer to a Node.js developer, naturally my JavaScript skills improved immensely which resulted in becoming a "full stack developer" due to the ability to also do frontend JavaScript too.

Because of that, I tried to stand out from the crowd and began billing myself not as a Full _STACK_ Developer, but as a Full _SNACK_ Developer. This has done great for catching peoples attentions. I even own the domain [full.snack.dev](https://full.snack.dev) which I used to talk about my skills, experience and somewhat a makeshift resume. Even helped immensely in getting new clients.

But I quit consulting last week. I am now focusing fully on being an entrepreneur and indie maker building my own products.

So with that said, adios my good snack friend.
