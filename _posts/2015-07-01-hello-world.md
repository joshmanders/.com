This site has been through so many changes since I registered it. Lets change it again!

One of the things I often wanted to do but could never really get the hang of was consistently blogging. This time I set a goal to blog at least once a week. I believe my reason previously was I felt I never had enough to blog about. I often felt that I needed to blog about something that everyone would want to read, or was more than a paragraph. I now feel that blogging really isn't about writing the next profound story, but really about just getting things you want to talk about off your chest.
